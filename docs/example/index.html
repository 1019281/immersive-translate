      <!--   The Lake Street Transfer station was a rapid transit station on the -->
      <!--   Chicago "L" that linked its Lake Street Elevated with the Logan Square -->
      <!--   branch of its Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad from 1913 to -->
      <!--   1951. -->

        This transfer station had a double-decked construction (depicted), with
        the Metropolitan's infrastructure crossing over the Lake Street. This
        arrangement continued until the Dearborn Street subway opened on
        February 25, 1951, replacing the Logan Square branch in the area and
        leading to the station's closure. The site would eventually serve as the
        junction of the modern Pink Line to the Green Line. (Full article...)
